										<p>
											Hey guys! How are you doing? I hope all of you are doing well. If you’re not, then know that you’re not alone and that soon you’ll see light at the end of the tunnel too!
										</p>
										<p>
										You’re probably wondering why I appear on your Newsfeed today. I admit that I have been very disengaged on social media (as I’ve always been), and that I admit too that I’m guilty of not replying to some of your texts – but I have reasons for that – hopefully I’ll be better on that.
									  </p>
										<p>
										The reason I make this video is to, first of all, say hello to my friends all over the world – I miss you all so dearly! Second reason is that I’d like to share with you an update on how I’ve been doing, coping and adapting to this new life. Well, it’s not a new life already, is it? ; ) Also, today marks the first day of my third year working in this university.
									  </p>
										<p>
										I’d like to keep this video a reasonable length so I’m just gonna go through things briefly. Hopefully I’ll be able to write what I shared here in more details so you can read about it.
										</p>
										<p>
										</p>
										<p>
											In this post, I’ll talk about:
											<br>
											<b>(1) What I've overcome last year (2020)
											<br>
											(2) What I’ve gained or achieved last year (2020)
											<br>
											(3) What events or activities contributed to the above two?
											<br>
											(4) What I want to achieve this year (2021).</b>
										</p>



										<h2 style="color:SlateBlue;">What have I overcome last year (2020)?</h2>
										<h3 style="color:SeaGreen;">Depression</h3>
										<p>
											I know the word depression sounds a little heavy. Perhaps if I say mental health or wellbeing, then it sounds a lot more bearable to hear. My very close circle of friends knows how much my mental health has been at an all-time low, especially towards the end of my PhD where I suffered from burnout and poor self-care, and then having to leave the place that have been my home during my PhD time to come back to my first home where I have to deal with reverse culture shock and transition into working environment. How have I overcome this?
										</p>
										<p>
											First of all, it’s thanks to mental health awareness that I was exposed to when I was abroad. The awareness is so widespread there that in the beginning I couldn’t fathom what mental health is about. But as I experience difficulties myself, and was advised to go for counselling during my second year of PhD, of which I was told that I didn’t need help because I have the capacity to deal with my problems. But I didn’t agree much with what the counsellor said.
										</p>
										<p>
											Thankfully, with the help of the Catholic Chaplaincy, I was introduced to different spiritual direction which has been of tremendous help and match my inherent need for transcendence at that time. Because of that, when I move back here, I felt like I lost this support, but at the back of my mind, I still know that depression is not something awful and incurable. It’s just that being in the state of depression and having to motivate yourself day-to-day when you are not in optimum condition that makes it difficult to bear for a sustained period of time. So, it is exactly why when you’re in this state, it’s important to detox your mind.
										</p>
										<p>
											My problem was that dealing with reverse culture shock and “new” environment that were overstimulating my mind that I couldn’t find a breather. I had this strong need to just take a break from everything – as in to not have anything at all: no PhD, no job, no nothing – just my being and my soul. At first, I thought taking a 2-month break travelling the world before I return to work was the break that I needed. While the travel has been fulfilling in many ways, it didn’t meet my goal of “taking a break” because my mind was overstimulated with many new things and I was physically tired too that I got sick during my travel, which made me feel guilty because the trip would’ve been better had I been in a better physical state.
										</p>

										<h3 style="color:SeaGreen;">Guilt (Past and present guilt, towards myself and others)</h3>
										<p>
											Past guilt towards myself are on things that I didn’t do which could’ve led me to prolong the reality of my dream life, while the past guilt towards others are things such as failing to be a good listener/ motivator especially when my well of empathy, patience, positivity, warmth has run dry and the rate of replenishing them has been very low due to the reasons I mentioned earlier.
										</p>
										<p>
											Current guilt involves the guilt for being the “changed/ abroad” me, which others may find off-putting as it has created a distance between the me who they knew then and the new me that they have to get to know again. It also goes the same way to me in terms of having to take a step back so that I can match with their way of life and thinking.
										</p>
										<p>
											Another guilt is about being difficult to adapt – this isn’t really a problem if people are understanding or open to embracing the new you. Sometimes it’s not that I couldn’t adapt. It’s more like, you know, there are better ways of doing things that can bring you progressive development compared to the current ways of doing things. But I know that it is human nature to resist or dislike change. So, I always have this thing battling inside me – doing things the way they do things here vs. doing things the way I would’ve done it abroad.
										</p>
										<p>
											In short, it’s me against the majority. And I have this big fear of losing the polished me if I blend in with the culture.
										</p>

										<h3 style="color:SeaGreen;">Self-criticism, Negative self-talk, Sense of urgency in work</h3>

										<p>
											The third, fourth and fifth items on my list are related – self-criticism, negative self-talk and sense of urgency in work. Those of you who know me really well would know that I have very high standards and expectations particularly of myself, and of others to some extent.
										</p>
										<p>
											Quoting Ayodeji Awosika, <i>“I’ve attached my identity to the results of my work,”</i> which led to this situation: <i>“Most of your hesitation in life comes from attaching your identity to the outcomes that happen in your life.”</i>
										</p>
										<p>
											I have always been one who want to produce good quality work, but the mounting and varied work here combined with different working attitude/ culture here make it hard to produce high quality work in a short time, so most of the time I don’t feel fulfilled doing any of the work given to me when I first started working here. In terms of teaching, when I first taught the students, I was surprised at how disconnected was my delivery with the students. The first batch of 	students I taught were the same age as one of my best friends, but there is such a striking difference in the level of maturity between them. I was appalled and wondering how am I going to deliver my teaching in a way that matches their level... All in all, teaching has been a stressful event for me because I struggle with trying different ways to effectively teach them.
										</p>
										<p>
											Anyway, the feeling that comes with a lack of fulfilment is really uncomfortable, so to escape from this feeling, I often want to finish my work as fast as I can so I don’t have to look at them anymore, which unknowingly have made me instil a sense of urgency in work – I would work day and night (poor self-care) but I soon learnt that such work can never finish, it’s never ending because that’s the nature of the work, it’s unlike projects where there is a starting point and a finishing line.
										</p>

										<h3 style="color:SeaGreen;">"It's them, not me. It's me, not them"</h3>
										<p>
											Last but not least, the final challenge that I overcome was self-blaming.
										</p>
										<p>
											I’ve realised these two things: <i>“It’s them, not me. “It’s me, not them”</i>.
										</p>
										<p>
											Confusing, is it?
										</p>
										<p>
										So, I’ll share this quote I saw on the newspaper the other day to clarify the first one: <i>“Sometimes the people around you won’t understand your journey. That’s okay. It’s not their journey, it’s yours. Embrace your freedom.”</i> – Kristen Butler.
										</p>
										<p>
										There were also circumstances that made me realise this point. One of the circumstances was when I attended an induction by my employer last year. It was during the session on “prosperous and harmonious country”, where I found <i>“closure”</i> to a long-standing issue that I’ve been trying to understand. Knowing about the country’s policy back then (in the 80s/ 90s) that led to the invisible but tangible effects of diversity tension, I finally was able to empathise with what the majority has been missing out on in terms of living in a diverse community due to the policy that has designed their life that way, and to some extent my resentment on this sensitive issue has eased off.
										</p>
										<p>
										Another session was on “first-world working culture” where it made me see that this is strongly emphasised in the country’s policy, but as usual, the implementation isn’t always straight-forward. But at least, knowing that the policy is in place, it gave me some sort of a reference point. That way, I became less annoyed or frustrated when dealing with people lacking the first-world working culture/ mentality, or in other words, when my work ethics, culture and quality are not reciprocated equally.
										</p>

										<h2 style="color:SlateBlue;">Gratitude: What have I gained/ achieved last year?</h2>

										<p>
											Next, let’s move on to what I've gained or achieved last year that I am grateful for. I’m going to just mention this as a list rather than elaborating each of them.
										</p>
										<p>

										1.	Stronger hair with greater volume<br>
										2.	Better physical and mental health<br>
										3.	Being kind to myself (self-care)<br>
										4.	Understanding my restlessness and gaining closure to some issues<br>
										5.	Wrote a book on Python (with great help from Robin on book publishing and Josiah on the content of the book)<br>
										6.	Conducted a workshop on Python<br>
										7.	Proper rest without guilt and completely shut down during the Christmas break<br>
										8.	Prioritisation without feeling guilty – say No to some tasks that I know I can’t help or perform with 100% commitment<br>
										9.	Joining CSA (thanks Google!) and Harvard geoengineering group (thanks Giorgio!)<br>
										10.	Diving in deep water (even though I didn’t finish the course because I got sick)<br>
										11.	Meaningful conversation with two new pals who motivated me through my slump<br>
										12.	Unconditional, continued support and encouragement from my former PhD supervisor in both professional and personal life<br>
										13.	Successfully obtained fundamental research grant with first application (with guidance from my former PhD supervisor)<br>

										</p>

										<h2 style="color:SlateBlue;">What activities/ events/ experiences contribute to the above two?</h2>
										<br>
										<h3 style="color:SeaGreen;">COVID-19 lockdown: 3-month national lockdown March - May 2020</h3>
										<br>
										<p>
											•	Being away from source of overstimulation, i.e. workplace.<br>
											<br>
											•	Spent 3-month lockdown in my friends’ parents’ house where they nourished me with nutritious food that helped me regain my health. I admit that I have a very bad habit of not eating properly and timely when I’m buried with work. It’s how I get iron-deficiency anaemia when I did my PhD and lost a significant amount of weight and often get sick and frequent migraines.
											<br><br>
											•	Being at my friends’ parents’ house, I was able to establish workout routine as they have a garden where I can conveniently go to for my morning and evening workout. Through these workouts, I feel connected to my athlete self and how nice it feels to exercise. The workout has definitely improved both my physical and mental health. Along with reducing coffee two weeks before my period begins, I no longer get severe period cramps (I never get period cramps until I was diagnosed with iron-deficiency anaemia because of poor eating habit) and migraines.
										</p>

										<h3 style="color:SeaGreen;">Diving <i>(although I didn't finish the course)</i></h3>
										<p>
										As I dive deep down (while struggling to balance out the pressure in my ear), the water seemed to be swirling around me. That experience made me feel directionless. And from that experience, I had a eureka moment where that experience actually described physically what I’ve been experiencing emotionally or mentally from all the reverse culture shock. It was wonderful to be able to give a “name” to what I can’t see but is there in my head.
										</p>

										<h3 style="color:SeaGreen;">Learning Data Science and Machine Learning</h3>

										<p>
											As with any learning, the learning curve is always steep in the beginning. When it comes to doing the assignments, I reached a point where I questioned myself if I’m doing the right thing or if I should find different assignments that are more relevant to my field of study. It was during this time that I decided to perform a second life review. I was apprehensive of doing a second life review as I felt it was a bit too early to do it. But I did it anyway. After examining my life in different dimensions, I came up with renewed mission and personal goals.
										</p>
										<p>
											What’s interesting is that these mission and goals I wrote in April 2020 were similar to what I wrote in May 2016. Had I not found my old journals, I wouldn’t have realised that!
										</p>
										<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">What is my mission?</p>

										<p>
											I want to help or make people happy. I want people to feel that they matter, and I want people to tap into the childhood innocence that is them so that they are not weighed down by the weight of the world.
										</p>
										<p>
											So imagine, if that was my mission, and I fail to do it, I would feel a sense of worthlessness and uselessness because I wasn’t able to do this. Why can’t I do it? A statement I spiritually heard during Eucharistic adoration on World Youth Day in Panama 2019 – You don’t let yourself be loved – came to mind. Only a year and three months later from when I first heard this statement that I finally understood what it meant – I was deprived of self-care. The COVID-19 break made me realised that.
										</p>
										<p>
											While many people are hit hard by COVID-19, I was saved by COVID-19, and for that I am grateful. During the COVID-19 break, I was able to reconnect with many international friends and even made new international friends too who motivated me through my slump.
										</p>

										<h3 style="color:SeaGreen;">Driving to Sg. Rual and Cameron Highlands</h3>
										<p>
											I don’t know how to describe this; all I can say is that the view of the mountainous forests (minus the agricultural farms and plantations) is very therapeutic.
										</p>

										<h3 style="color:SeaGreen;">Family time</h3>
										<p>
											•	I remember around early or mid-June 2020, I felt strong enlightenment and transcendence where I felt tremendously grateful and light, as if there were no longer black clouds looming over my head. It felt so great that I was afraid to acknowledge it because I was afraid of losing this feeling. But over time, I was convinced that I was on the path to healing or that healing has already taken place and that is why I felt strong sense of enlightenment, transcendence and gratitude. So… was it in July or August that I told my cousins and family that I have overcome my depression (I didn’t tell them that I was struggling with depression, only my very close friends including my former PhD supervisor know about it).
											<br><br>
											•	I had a rough time adjusting to living with family members when I came home for holidays, because there was no “system” in place and what’s normal for them is not normal for me. So I started decluttering, cleaning and reorganising the house so that a system is in place and that it’s intuitive, so that there’s not much thinking to do for small stuff.
											<br><br>
											•	Christmas holiday. I am grateful for the teamwork I had with my brother when we hosted Christmas dinner. I was also grateful to myself, haha yea, to my poor self, that I was able to not be hard on myself to “fit in” with my extended family members. Yes, the things they enjoy now, i.e., karaoke, are things that I used to enjoy before too. But I no longer enjoy it, or I guess I do enjoy it in the right company. So instead of feeling uneasy about having to force myself to enjoy it and take part in it, I told myself to just offer my presence of being there. I do admit that there was a limit to how much I can offer my presence that time, but I told myself to just extend it a little more, a little more. I'm also thankful that my head of department respected my holiday and waited until I came back from the holiday before letting me know of an important task.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>Bottom line is,</strong> I learnt that I never really know how to care for myself because I always feel like I’m not entitled for it, that I haven’t done enough to be entitled for such great care. You know, the very first time I felt cared for was in 2016 when I had a talk with my PhD supervisor about quitting PhD. One question he asked really touched the core of my being. He asked, “Do you want me to give you less pressure?” In my heart, I was like, “Do I deserve it?” At that time, I felt like I was someone… I was human… My world went topsy-turvy when I realised that, thinking how this reality can be different from where I come from. And that is when my life began to change, slowly, for the better. Having to return to my old world, I fear that the better part of me would slowly be stripped apart. But as my former PhD supervisor said, I have the assertiveness of my mother, so I must use that to stand my ground and contribute to positive changes in my workplace, and that I did. I can feel that I am in a lot better position than when I started two years ago. I’ve identified colleagues who I can work with and some of my colleagues have really started letting me be me with my strict quality control. So, I’m grateful for that. On my birthday last year, two words kept swimming in my head – positive and supportive. My former PhD supervisor said that he thinks my career path should be with people in a supportive environment with a common goal and helping people or doing something useful.
										</p>

										<h1 style="color:SlateBlue;">What do I want to achieve/ do this year (2021)?</h1>
										<br>
										<h4 style="color:SeaGreen;">Aim</h4>
										<p>
											To focus and gather my energy on important things that will bring me closer to my fulfilment and purpose.
										</p>

										<h4 style="color:SeaGreen;">Theme 1: Innovation</h4>
										<p>
											I wish to build an app this year. I have some ideas in mind, but I’m not sure which to choose yet. I started learning Kotlin for two days last month and managed to create a simple static Happy Birthday app. I thought I would have the entire February to create a simple functional app but some other urgent things popped up so I had to postpone my little project.
										</p>
										<p>
											However, to my surprise, an admin colleague came to me for consultation on Python yesterday. I thought he was going to ask about data analysis, turns out it was more on development Python rather than analysis Python. Seeing that he drove 40 mins to campus, I feel bad if he goes home empty handed. So there and then I learnt Tkinter and helped him with his assignment in 4 hours.
										</p>
										<p>
											I was surprised and impressed at the same time that I was able to create a simple GUI in 4 hours without prior knowledge.
											<br><br>
											My former PhD supervisor once said to me that I suffer from a lack of confidence in my abilities, not in lack of abilities. And BAM, that is so true. The experience of creating a simple, functional GUI in 4 hours yesterday made me feel and think that I should believe in myself more.
										</p>
										<p>
											It’s also funny how things flow in the same direction. What I mean is that, one of my goals this year revolves around app development. Even when my little project is stalled, other things that pop up my way are also along the line of app development.
											<br><br>
											Not to mention that I’m also currently leading a team on designing new academic programme on analytics in environmental fields. Programming, something that I struggled with during my PhD, has opened up a pathway for me to contribute my skills : ) I like to say that my PhD journey was geeking me into the future haha
										</p>


										<h4 style="color:Green;">Theme 2: Eco-minimalism living</h4>
										<p>
											I have been thinking to be a lifestyle influencer (hm, I don’t really like to use that word) because many people have requested me to start a channel to share about my life and support people who are finding life hard.
										</p>
										<p>
											I was told that the reason people connect with me is that I am honest and warm and give people my attention, but I don’t feel confident sharing about my life, tips and advice, to which he said “There is no right or wrong if you talk from the heart. It is just fact”.
										</p>
										<p>
											Whether or not I am going to make a video channel on this, I will let the situation unravel itself. What I will focus on is to continue my eco-minimalistic living that I practised abroad and find ways to localise the global minimalism practices so that it is doable for everyone on this side of the world. Another reason why I wanted to promote or advocate eco-minimalism living is that, after talking to a bunch of youths, I find that they are lacking direction on how to contribute to the world. While I can’t give them a personalised plan, I can at least help by setting an example.
